Highlight the highest voted comments in GitHub to quickly locate the best solutions.

When you visit a Github issue or pull request, this extension runs quietly in the background and pinpoints sections along the scrollbar where positively voted comments are located. Each highlight is weighted by the count and type of reactions which varies the height of the highlight - the longer the highlight, the greater chance that's the solution you're looking for in the thread.

Download the extension and just let it simply do its thing while you investigate.

Please share your feedback! And as always, please rate this extension as you would the most helpful comment!
