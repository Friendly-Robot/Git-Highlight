Highlight the highest voted comments in GitHub issues to quickly locate the best solutions.

When you visit a Github issue, this extension runs quietly in the background and pinpoints sections along the scrollbar where positively voted comments are located. Each highlight is weighted by the count of reactions which varies the height of the highlight -- the longer the highlight, the greater chance that's the solution you're looking for.

Download the extension and let it simply do its thing while you do yours. Just don't go down the wrong rabbit hole!

Please share your feedback! And as always, please rate the extension like you would the best solution!
